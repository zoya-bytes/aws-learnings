# Auto Scaling or AWS Auto Scaling

Auto Scaling group service intigrates with Cloudwatch and it will monitor the resources on  a metric that you have given or set. eg:CPU utilization, if CPU utilization crossed the threshold it can adjust the capacity by adding the more instances on your autoscaling group. which is based on Cloudwatch alarms, so while creating Auto Scaling we need to create alarms too(to add or remove the capacity). Adding the capacity to maintain the performance or removing the capacity to maintain the cost.

## How this Works?

AWS AUTO SCALING (Unified scaling for your cloud applications) > EXPLORE YOUR APPLICATIONS > DISCOVER WHAT YOU CAN SCALE > CHOOSE WHAT TO OPTIMIZE > TRACK SCALING AS IT HAPPENS.
